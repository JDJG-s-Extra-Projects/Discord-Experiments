# SlashAttachmentTestBot
Using Chiggy's wip branch :shrug: this is how I do it.
A.k.a to test slash commands with the attachment value.
Please note it's on Senarc, as Senarc is a group meant for helping other developers, and I would rather not host a test bot for this, hence why I am asking Benitz to help me host them(this is much better than using my old testing bots)
